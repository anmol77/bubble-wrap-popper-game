## Bubble Wrap Popper Game
Most of us have popped bubble wraps - a thin sheet of bubbles that wrapped items so that it can absorb any shock from outside. And popping those bubbles were fun. This is what the game is about.

## Rules
You have 30 seconds to pop as much bubble was you want. The ghost comes randomly to unpop the bubble. If the bubble is popped, one score is given and if it is unpopped by ghost, the point decreases. You aim to pop as many bubbles as you want in 30 seconds of time. The last 10 seconds, ghosts come in larger amount. So get to popping !
    
    - score > 0  ->  "Ghosts are winning! 👻";
    - score > 15 -> "Popping champion! 🏆";
    - score > 20 -> "Good popping! 💪";
